Biological systems such as organisms, cells, or biomolecules 
are highly organized in their structure and function,  \cite{Klipp16} 
[structure which is a consequence of evolution]. 
[Such structures can help study the and compare biological functions of  
different organisms]. [In order to understand, formalize and abstract these structures 
some kind of modeling is needed, be it mathematical or not (what not?)].

[The problem is the one of data integration, i.e. partial information in distributed
databases is needed]. 
[One such data source is Reactome \cite{Fabregat2018}, which is a qualitative network database]
[The goal with this work is to use qualitative data in the Reactome database to generate 
quantitative models, and use BBO (cite something) techinques to "validate" 
(validate is not good, find something else) these models]

[Validating complex biological models is a computationally intensive task (cite something)
thus HPC clusters are required in order. ] 
{Such clusters may not always be fully available 
(i.e. there are multiple users and multiple experiments running on the cluster +
there are some limits on job running times),
so in order to better distribute the load of the validation task some infrastructure
work is needed.}
