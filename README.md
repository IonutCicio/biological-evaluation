# bsys-eval

bsys-eval is a tool meant to help study the likelihood of a given scenario in
a biological system.

Given a set of _target species_, a set of constraints on the _target species_
(constraints which model a scenario that could present, for example, in a
disease) and by taking into account all the reactions that lead to the
production, both directly and indirectly, of the _target species_, the goal is
to find a subset of virtual patients for the situation.

High Concentration Molecules

Estrogen: A steroid hormone that freely diffuses across cell membranes
Calcium ions (Ca²⁺): Present in high concentrations within cellular compartments, particularly important for amplifying signals
β-Actin: A structural protein maintaining high concentrations as part of the cytoskeletal framework



Low Concentration Molecules

Dopamine: A neurotransmitter present in very low concentrations but highly effective in signaling
Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF): A growth factor typically found in trace amounts due to its potent effects
HER2: A signaling protein that requires minimal amounts for effective signaling
